					Hey, I'm Yashraj221B, a 17-year-old self-taught coding enthusiast! I've been tinkering with programming since I was 13, diving into everything from software and web development to automation scripts. I speak Python, C#, JavaScript, Rust, and HTML/CSS, with a side of Java, C/C++, and Go. I'm also into computer networking. My goal? To be a kickass software developer, pushing boundaries and making cool stuff!
